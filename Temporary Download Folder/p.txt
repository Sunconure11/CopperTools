[B]Copper Tools[/B] is a small Minecraft mod about mod compatibility and alternatives to vanilla tools. (I know that everybody uses TiCon, but just stay with me here) It adds a whole lot of tool and armor sets made out of various materials from different mods, like copper or tin. Also, these tools are fully configurable for you Iguana Tweaks users and modpack authors out there.

It's another one of those "made it to learn Java" kind of mod, so it's very basic. But hopefully it will have more advanced features once I figure out how to implement them.

[spoiler="Tool material properties"]
Version 0.1 only has two sets, but it's easy to make them, so I will add more in the newt version. This spoiler does not contain numbers, you can look at the source code for that.
[B]Copper:[/B] mines a bit faster than iron, because in the Minecraft world precious metals are faster. It has around as much durability as stone, protects and deals damage like iron, and is good for enchanting. Can't mine diamonds.
[B]Platinum:[/B] has the same speed as gold, and almost as much durability as iron. Platinum swords and armor are as efficient as iron, and it is as enchantable as gold. As you can, it's quite overpowered, and that's why platinum tools require obsidian rods (can be changed via the config)[/spoiler]
